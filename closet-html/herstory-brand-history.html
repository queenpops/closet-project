    <header> Tips to Shop Mindfully & Ethically </header>
    <ol> <!--change from a numbered list in css-->
      <li> Swap! Host or participate in a local clothing swap </li>
      <li> Thrift! Keep clothes out of landfills & save $$$ </li>
      <li> Mend/Alter/Tailor! Due to the rise of consumerism, we don't always think of mending or alterations as an option for our beloved garments. This is definitely a worthwhile option to explore! </li>
      <li> Ask Brands: Who Made My Clothes? Check out the movement from <a href="https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/why-do-we-need-a-fashion-revolution/" target="_blank" class="fashrevlink"> Fashion Revolution </a>. Demand transparency from brands and designers. Try to do the research. If the information is not available, look into purchasing from brands and makers who are transparent about their supply chains. Working conditions, labour rights and environmental impact are some key factors to consider. My policy: if a brand ISN'T openly offering (or shouting about) their ethical and sustainable policies, they probably have something to hide. </li>
      <li> Watch out for Green Washing! This is becoming a bigger problem, as the demand for sustainable and ethical practices is on the rise. Brands will offer a crumb of sustainability (look! we made a t-shirt with organic cotton!), yet continue to produce & market disposable fast fashion, and/or disregard labour rights and other elements related to environmental impact, for example. It's a lot to review! Try to look at the company as a whole. </li>
